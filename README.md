# WORLD COST SORTER

## Description
From a list of words, it calculates the easiest ones from a typing perspective.
It also includes a fast random string generator for testing purposes.

## Usage
### String generation
gen.exe \<filename\> \<string length\> \<number of lines\>

### Sorting
sorter.exe \<filename\> \[verbosity\]
Note : The verbosity argument corresponds to the amount of progress needed to print a new result. Default is 0.5.

## Why
I made this project a long time ago to find the most accessible domain possible.
From a list of available domains, I was able to calculate and find the ones that are easy to type, so easy and fast to access.
